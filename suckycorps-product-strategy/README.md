# ü§ñ SuckyCorps Product Strategy ‚Äì Robot Vacuum Evaluation

**Tools:** Python, Data Scoring Logic, Presentation Design  
**Skills:** Product Analysis, Strategic Thinking, Data-Driven Recommendations

---

## ‚úÖ About the Project
This project evaluated four autonomous robot vacuum models from "SuckyCorps" to determine the most effective product based on performance consistency and strategic positioning. It combined analytical scoring with business recommendations to guide product development and marketing.

---

## ‚ùì The Problem
SuckyCorps needed to make strategic decisions about which robot vacuum models to continue, discontinue, or reposition. The challenge was identifying not just top-performing models, but those offering the best value-to-consistency tradeoff using structured analysis.

## üìà Results & Insights
- Designed a scoring system to compare performance across dirt and wall density maps  
- Identified **‚ÄúOmniscient Sucky‚Äù** as the premium model due to highest mean score and lowest variance  
- Recommended discontinuation of low-performing models and repositioning others based on cost-benefit tradeoff  
- Communicated results through visuals and a strategy presentation  
- Connected technical performance to **business strategy and ROI** considerations
