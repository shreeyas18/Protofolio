**Tools:** R, ARIMA, ETS, Forecasting Schemes  
**Skills:** Forecasting, Time Series Analysis, Model Evaluation, Team Management

## About the Project
Led a team of five to forecast monthly U.S. airline passenger traffic from 2003‚Äì2023 using time series models.

## The Problem
How can we accurately forecast airline passenger volumes to support industry planning? Evaluated ARIMA, ARMA(1,1), and ETS models with different forecast schemes.

## Results
- Achieved ~50% reduction in error with combined forecasting methods  
- Presented findings in a comprehensive report and presentation  
- Delivered actionable recommendations for future forecasting
