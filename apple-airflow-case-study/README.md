# 🍏 Apple ML Workflow Automation – Airflow Case Study

**Tools:** Apache Airflow, Papermill, Jupyter, Kubernetes  
**Skills:** Business Analysis, ML Workflow Automation, Strategic Communication

---

## ✅ About the Project
This case study analyzes Apple’s internal machine learning workflow infrastructure, specifically their use of Apache Airflow and Papermill to automate and scale ML model training and deployment across languages and platforms.

---

## ❓ The Problem
Apple needed a way to support its rapidly growing number of ML experiments and pipelines across teams. The challenge was building a unified platform that was scalable, modular, and supportive of multiple languages (Python, Scala, etc.) while remaining production-ready.

## 📈 Results & Insights
- Evaluated Apple’s architecture and its use of tools like Airflow, Jupyter, and Kubernetes  
- Identified key system actors, pipeline triggers, and technical preconditions  
- Highlighted improvements made to Papermill operator for multi-language notebooks  
- Linked Airflow integration to **descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics use cases**  
- Proposed future improvements such as MLflow tracking, event-based architecture, and better debug logging
