# 🌲 Ensemble Learning & Overfitting Labs

**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn  
**Skills:** Ensemble Models, Overfitting Detection, Regularization, Boosting, Bagging

---

## ✅ About the Project  
This project includes two related labs: one focusing on **overfitting and regularization**, and the other exploring **ensemble learning techniques** such as bagging and boosting. These techniques are widely used to improve model generalization and accuracy.

---

## ❓ The Problem  
How do we reduce overfitting in machine learning models while preserving predictive performance? What’s the best way to combine multiple weak learners into a strong model?

---

## 📈 Results & Highlights  
- Simulated models with **different complexity settings** to observe underfitting and overfitting  
- Applied **Ridge and Lasso regularization** to reduce model variance  
- Built and compared **ensemble methods** like:
  - **Random Forest**
  - **Bagging Classifier**
  - **AdaBoost**
- Visualized accuracy improvement and error reduction using ensemble strategies  
- Learned to tune hyperparameters for balance between bias and variance
