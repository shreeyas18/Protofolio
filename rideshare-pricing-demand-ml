# 🚕 Rideshare Pricing & Demand Dynamics – ML Capstone

A Machine Learning Exploration Using Uber & Lyft Data in Boston  
📅 June 2025 | 🎓 Seattle University – OMSBA 5500 Capstone  
👩‍💼 Led by: Shreeya Sampat | Collaborators: Kezuwera Dibeley, Victor Macedo

## 📌 Project Overview

This project investigates the underlying drivers of surge pricing, ride fare variability, and short-term demand forecasting in the rideshare industry. As the **team lead**, I directed the project’s technical pipeline from data integration and cleaning to model development, interpretation, and final reporting. I ensured that our methods addressed both analytical rigor and practical relevance.

Using real-world Uber and Lyft data from Boston, we applied machine learning and time series forecasting to uncover insights related to:

- **Surge pricing prediction**
- **Weather impact on ride pricing**
- **Socioeconomic fairness in fare distribution**
- **Short-term demand forecasting**

---

## 🧪 Core Research Questions

1. What features are most predictive of surge pricing?
2. How do weather conditions influence ride prices?
3. Can future ride demand be forecasted using time, location, and weather data?

## 🧵 Project Contributions (Led by Shreeya Sampat)

- Designed and executed the full data science workflow  
- Merged and cleaned trip, weather, and income datasets  
- Led all modeling phases: classification, regression, and time-series  
- Created visualizations and interpreted model outputs  
- Authored and formatted final reports and team presentation  
- Ensured fairness analysis and stakeholder relevance were addressed

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- Surge pricing is **strongly driven by time of day, ride distance, and ZIP-level income**
- Higher-income neighborhoods face **more frequent and costlier** surge pricing
- Weather has **modest but consistent effects** on ride prices
- Prophet can forecast **daily/weekly demand cycles** with solid accuracy (MAPE: 12.5%)

---

## ⚖️ Fairness & Equity Observations

Although income was not used as a direct model input, pricing and surge frequency **correlate highly with location**, creating **indirect bias**. This raises ethical concerns about algorithmic pricing and suggests a need for:

- **Transparency reports**
- **Fairness audits**
- **Surge caps or credits** in underserved areas

---

## 📌 Future Work

- Incorporate real-time traffic and event signals  
- Expand analysis across seasons and multiple cities  
- Use fairness metrics (e.g., disparate impact) to evaluate pricing equity  
- Partner with municipal transit planners for collaborative insights
