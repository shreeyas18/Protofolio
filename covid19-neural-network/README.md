# 🧠 COVID-19 Forecasting using Neural Networks

**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, MLPRegressor  
**Skills:** Predictive Modeling, Time Series Forecasting, Model Tuning, Error Analysis

---

## ✅ About the Project
This project involved building a neural network using Python to forecast global COVID-19 case trends. The model was designed to capture country-level case dynamics and provide accurate time-based predictions.

---

## ❓ The Problem
Accurate forecasting of COVID-19 cases was essential for public health planning and resource allocation. The challenge was to develop a model that could generalize well across countries with different case trajectories.

## 📈 Results & Highlights
- Developed a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** model using `scikit-learn`  
- Tuned hyperparameters (hidden layers, activation function, iterations) for optimal performance  
- Achieved a best-case **R² score of 0.9396**, indicating strong predictive accuracy  
- Visualized **average absolute error by country** to evaluate model performance  
- Used a real-world dataset with over 200K rows, containing daily case counts across multiple countries  
- Communicated findings using charts and error analysis plots
