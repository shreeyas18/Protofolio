# 🧠 COVID-19 Forecasting using Neural Networks

**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, MLPRegressor  
**Skills:** Predictive Modeling, Neural Networks, Cross-Validation, Error Analysis

---

## ✅ About the Project  
Built a neural network model in Python to forecast new COVID-19 cases based on historical global data. The goal was to identify the optimal network architecture for making accurate predictions across different countries.

---

## ❓ The Problem  
Forecasting COVID-19 case numbers is critical for governments and public health leaders to allocate resources and plan policies. The model needed to generalize across countries and provide strong predictive performance with minimal error.

---

## 📈 Results & Highlights  
- Used a real-world dataset of weekly case counts across multiple countries  
- Designed and tested **8 different MLP architectures**  
- Best result: **S6 setting (3 layers × 10 neurons)** achieved **R² = 0.9396**  
- Performed 5-fold cross-validation to validate model robustness  
- Final model was used to predict new cases in **US, Spain, Italy, and Canada**  
- Average absolute error was visualized per country (see chart)
