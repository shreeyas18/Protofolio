# 🌍 World’s Fair Evolution – Tableau Dashboard

**Tools:** Tableau, Tableau Public  
**Skills:** Data Visualization, Trend Analysis, Dashboard Design, Historical Research

---

## ✅ About the Project  
This Tableau dashboard presents a visual analysis of **World’s Fairs** (Expositions) across time, highlighting trends in cost, country participation, and fair types. The goal was to communicate insights from over 150 years of global exposition data in a clean and interactive format.

---

## ❓ The Problem  
World’s Fairs are massive international exhibitions with historical significance — but their cost, reach, and frequency have changed dramatically. This project explores:
- The rising **cost of fairs**  
- The **geographic spread** of host countries  
- The shift between **World Expos** and **Specialized Expos**

---

## 📈 Results & Highlights

- Built a **multi-panel Tableau dashboard** with:
  - Bar chart of **cost per fair over time**  
  - Country participation & host frequency  
  - Filterable views by **expo category** and year  
- Identified that costs rose sharply after 1950 — peaking at **$4.2B in 2010**  
- World Expos have become more commercially intensive; Specialized Expos remain smaller in scale  
- Dashboard included interactivity like category filters, hover labels, and tooltips
